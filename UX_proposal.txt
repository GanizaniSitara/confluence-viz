Below is a compact “toolbox” of reusable UX patterns that teams often combine to make large-scale review-and-delete flows feel safe, quick and (critically) trust-building for users. Mix-and-match as needed for wikis, Confluence, mail, photos, music libraries, etc.

---

### 1 — “Spring-Cleaning” Dashboard

* **What it is:** A single landing surface that aggregates potentially stale items across sources (e-mails > 2 yrs, wiki pages w/ zero views in 12 mos, photos flagged low-quality, etc.).
* **Why it helps:** Users start with a bird’s-eye view and can decide where to drill down instead of hunting in many places.
* **Key UI hints:**

  * Prominent filters for **age**, **owner**, **space/project**, **file type**.
  * Sort by “deletion confidence” (see #4) as default, but allow switching to last-modified or size to tackle low-hanging fruit first.

---

### 2 — Batch Review Queue

* **Chunk items** into digestible sets (10–25).
* Use a **card stack** or **list-table** with keyboard shortcuts (← keep, → delete, space = preview).
* Keep quick stats in the header—“2.1 GB reclaimed so far” and “18 kept / 7 deleted”.

---

### 3 — High-Fidelity Preview & Context

Before a user presses Delete:

* Show an **inline preview** (render wiki diff, thumbnail photo, 20-line e-mail snippet).
* Show **metadata chips**: last editor, last viewer, inbound links, sharing status, file size.
* If something is referenced elsewhere, surface a small **“Used in X places”** warning.

---

### 4 — Machine-Learning Assist with Transparency

* Train on past deletions, inactivity, low engagement, duplicates, low-quality signals.
* Surface a **confidence badge** (“High”, “Medium”, “Low”) + a short rationale, e.g. “No views since Nov 2022”.
* Provide a **thumbs-up / thumbs-down** so the model learns and users feel in control.

---

### 5 — Soft Delete & Grace Period (“Undo-Window”)

* Items go to a **Recycle Bin / Trash** for 30–90 days.
* Show a “Just deleted? Undo” snackbar for a few seconds to reduce friction toward bulk actions.
* Allow self-service restore; send a weekly “Trash summary” e-mail so nothing silently vanishes.

---

### 6 — Progressive Disclosure of Destructive Actions

* Default action is **“Archive”**; “Delete permanently” is hidden behind a chevron or separate tab.
* Use calm language (“Remove”, “Regain space”) rather than alarming red danger text until final confirmation.

---

### 7 — Similarity Clustering (“Review All Like This”)

* Group by:

  * **File hash / near-duplicate** photos,
  * **Topic classification** for docs/e-mails,
  * **Unused attachments**.
* Let the user accept a whole cluster in one click, accelerating clean-up.

---

### 8 — Momentum & Gamification

* **Progress ring / bar** showing percentage of suggested items reviewed.
* Micro-copy like “You’re 80 % of the way to inbox zero—keep going!”
* Optional **streaks** or “space freed” milestones.

---

### 9 — Scheduled Nudges (“Time-boxed Audits”)

* After big imports or project closures, pop a **just-in-time card**: “Lots of content created 6 months ago—review now?”
* Offer an opt-in **automated monthly digest**: top candidates + quick action links.

---

### 10 — Safety Valve for Enterprise Roles

* Respect **data-retention policies**—show a lock icon and tooltip when deletion isn’t permitted.
* Route “request deletion” to the right data-owner if user lacks permission.

---

## Putting It Together

1. **Entry point:** Spring-Cleaning Dashboard (#1).
2. **Triage loop:** Batch Review Queue (#2) + transparent ML suggestions (#4).
3. **Decision aid:** High-Fidelity Preview (#3) with Similarity Clustering (#7).
4. **Commit phase:** Soft Delete w/ Undo (#5) plus Progress Gamification (#8).
5. **Learning cycle:** Feedback clicks feed the model; scheduled nudges (#9) keep the space tidy.

### Tiny Implementation Tips

* Indexing: store **last-accessed timestamps** and **inbound-link counts** for each object upfront to avoid costly queries.
* Accessibility: ensure keyboard-only review flow; announce success/undo via ARIA live regions.
* Performance: lazy-load thumbnails; prefetch next batch while the user reviews the current one.
* Trust: log every deletion in an **Activity Feed** with self-serve restore to eliminate fear.

Use these patterns as Lego bricks—adapt terminology and visual style to your product, but keep the core principles: *surface with context, decide in batches, undo is easy, and the system learns from every choice.*
